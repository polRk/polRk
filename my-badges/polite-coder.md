<strong>I am a polite coder.</strong>

I use words like "thanks" and "please" in my issues:

- <a href="https://github.com/ZijianHe/koa-router/issues/511">#511</a>: Map of middleware doesn't work
- <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/issues/4860">#4860</a>: Open Telemetry Monitoring supports
- <a href="https://github.com/denoland/std/issues/5675">#5675</a>: Add support streaming json parsing from array of objects
- <a href="https://github.com/connectrpc/connect-es/issues/1453">#1453</a>: AbortSignal rejects with Code.Internal instead of Code.Canceled
- <a href="https://github.com/prisma/prisma1/issues/4042">#4042</a>: Won't start backup by crontab

 And many more...
